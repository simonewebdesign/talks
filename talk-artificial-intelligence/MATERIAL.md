3) Deep Learning

    - Computers can learn/see/listen
    - Can read/write
    - Cannot reason/understand
    - Better than people
    - Human and Computer can work together
    - Rather than handcrafting, we create algorithms that "learn"

 Q. What is artificial intelligence?

A. It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. ("somewhat intelligent" because it's not actual intelligence)

 Q. Yes, but what is intelligence?

A. Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines.

 Q. Isn't there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn't depend on relating it to human intelligence?

A. Not yet. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent.

AI is a machine that learns to do tasks usually done by humans

What is important for AI is to have algorithms as capable as people at solving problems. The identification of subdomains for which good algorithms exist is important, but a lot of AI problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains.

Transcendence - film with Johnny Depp
AI could be an existential threat to humanity
Stephen Hawking: AI will be 'either best or worst thing' for humanity 
“Every aspect of our lives will be transformed. In short, success in creating AI could be the biggest event in the history of our civilisation.”


Types of AI in terms of approach

- Strong AI - Simulating the human brain - systems that think
- Weak AI - Behaves like a human but doesn't give us an insight into how the brain works - (e.g. Deep Blue)
