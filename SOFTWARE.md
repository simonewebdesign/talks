## Software to use for presentations

- https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat -  Terminal-based presentations using Pandoc (which supports anything, e.g. markdown)
- impress.js - prezi-like presentation, very impressive indeed
- reveal.js - very famous and stunning
- bespoke.js - the framework used in the `Object.observe` talk “A State of Change”. You can use the yeoman generator to quickly get started: https://github.com/bespokejs/generator-bespoke
